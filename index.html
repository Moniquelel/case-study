    THE PROJECT: 
    <br>
    
    For this project we developed a mobile application centered around helping young adults find shows for local artists in their area. I had a hand in the entire design process from concept to iteration. 
    
    <br>
    MY RESPONSIBILITIES:
    <br>
    User Testing
    Competitive analysis
    Empathy map
    Wireframes
    Low/HIgh Fidelity Prototypes

      <p class="card-text">Build Research Plan
        In order to gather more information, we first sent out a short survey via Google that asks general questions about travel to gauge general travel patterns and feeling.
        
        Conduct One on One Interviews and Send out Survey
        Then, we conducted six 15-20 minute interviews to understand the userâ€™s needs and pain points with finding local concerts.
        
        Review Data and Asses
        After reviewing the qualitative and quantitative data we will compose a user persona.
        
        Objectives:
        To understand how young adults find and attend concerts in their local community, and any roadblocks they run into along the way. 
        Do people struggle with finding local music?
        Is there a way we can make finding local music easier?

          <p class="card-text">We conducted multiple one on one user interviews and synthesized the findings into an affinity diagram. We did this to better understand the gap in the market, and understand any current gaps with existing applications. Additionally we wanted to understand the core needs of users and the most efficient way to solve them.

What features we desired in those apps and then imagined any scenario that could not only fill any gaps but create solutions to unidentified problems.

      <p class="card-text">To dig into a users frustrations and roadblocks while trying to find a ticket to a concert we theorised a typical user journey. Going through each step in the process and analyzing typical thoughts and feelings a user would go through. This helped us understand a simple and clear flow a user may take while using our application.

      <h5 class="card-title">WIREFRAMES:</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Before creating any visual designs or prototypes we created wireframes. This ensured we had a clear user path for our application. As well it allowed us to do guerilla testing and usability testing to confirm we had a clear path for the user to take to accomplish their task. 
        It also allowed us the time to create clear hierarchy and readability before we implemented visual design. </p>

      <p class="card-text">For our final prototype we implemented a consistent design. We wanted an inviting color scheme as well as bold animations. Additionally we wanted to make sure there was strong accessibility with our type, colors, and sizing. Guaranteeing any user would easily be able to use our application.
